# Pixel Vanish Backend


### Configuration
Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add the following configuration:


  `PORT=4000` \
  `VERSION="v1"`\
  `API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"`

  Replace your_actual_api_key_here with the API key you obtained for your application on https://app.photoroom.com/. This way, you can access the image editing feature using this API key in your local development environment.
